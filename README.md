# Ai Virtual Keyboard

An Ai Virtual Keyboard built with Python and OpenCV modules. 

## Implementation and Results

The Keyboard letters are fixed on the screen at certain coordinates. The Camera will capture our hand and detect our hand and finger movements and then it will compare with 
the location of the keyboard key on the screen. If it matches, then the action associated with that key is triggered. Using this, the user can type letters on the screen or
in a text editor like a notepad.
